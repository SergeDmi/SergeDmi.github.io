# Carbon emissions
A small repo to gather values of CO2 emissions. While no value is exact, orders of magnitude are a very powerful tools in the hand of citizens. 

### First estimates
The carbon emission for first world countries is of the order of (see  [^spreadsheet]) 10 tons per inhabitant per year, i.e. 
30 kg/day/capita. This includes all the industrial activities of the country. But because such activities are consumed by citizens, this should give a fair idea of our consumption ! See this source ([^ourworld]) for more information and detailed sources.

Note that typically, "western"/1st world countries import more CO2 than they export, so the numbers tend to be under-estimated for those world countries and over-estimated for less rich manufacturing countries.  

On average, agriculture represents 20% (considered directly [^data_sector]) up to 30% ([^food]) of greenhouse gaz emissions. This is highly country-dependent though, and this number seems only 10% in the US, where transportation accounts for 28% ! [^EPA_sources]
All integrated, livestock seem to account for 18% of carbon emissions [^fao_livestock]. 


### CO2 - power equivalence
Coal, fuel, natural gaz are of the order 1kg CO2 emission per kW.h ([^US_eia]).

In Europe, we are at ~0.3 kg / kW.h ([^EU_eea]). Note that countries using coal (e.g. Germany, 2.25% of the worlds' CO2 emissions) have larger emissions than countries using nuclear (e.g. France, 0.95% of the worlds CO2 emissions).    

A light bulb consumes 15W, i.e. 360 W.h a day, i.e. 130 kW.h a year, i.e. 40 kg per year.  

### Clothing
Clothing represents about 10% of carbon emissions worldwide [^worldbank].
 
### Flights
On average, for fuel only, a flight emits 100g per passenger km, so about 100kg per hour per passenger ([^carbon_flight]). 
This is an under-estimation because of the other costs, but order-of-magnitude wise consistent with more precise counts ([^flight_calculator]).  
This yields about 1 ton CO2 for a trans-atlantic flight, i.e. over a month of CO2 for an average person.

### transportation
A modern car produces about 12kg per 100km.

### Food
Food represents roughly around a quarter of mankind's emissions [^shrink], i.e. on average 2.5 tons per year per inhabitant.
A vegeterian diet reduces this footprint by 30%. So one can reduce their emission by 7.5% by following a vegetarian diet.

Beef has a very strong carbon footprint. A 200g steack emits about 12kg of carbon [^local].
Compare that to 1.4kg for pork and 1.2 for chicken... and 200g for the same mass of corn. 

Food waste is responsible for 6%  [^data_sector] to 8% [^uno_waste] of greenhouse gaz emissions, consistent with about 30% of food being wasted [^waste].

Overall, food transport has a very limited impact on its carbon footprint.
Focusing on eating less carbon-intensive sources is far more efficient than focusing on eating local [^local].

### Phones 
A modern smartphone is around 90kg of CO2 [^mobile], i.e. about 3 days worth for an average european. The usage of the smarthphone is around 315kg/year [^mobile], i.e. about 3% of our carbon footprint.

### bitcoin
Bitcoin consumes at least 50 TWh annualy [^bitcoin0], we represents at least 10  milion tons of CO2, and probably closer to 20 to 40 [^bitcoin1][^bitcoin0].


### Significant behavioural change
What do you think ?

### Insignificant behavioural changes
Don't make yourself just feel good, act useful !
