## Ongoing projects  

### Pushing force by branched actin networks
Branched actin networks exert pushing forces in conditions in-vivo, wether in [yeast endocytosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418308006), in lamelipodia, or in [podosomes in macrophages](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30652-6).  Because actin nucleation-promoting factors locate at the plasma membrane, tt is widely believed that actin networks exert pushing forces by polymerizing at the membrane/actin interface. While for individual actin filaments, the force-distance relationship is well described by the [brownian ratchet](https://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495(93)81035-X.pdf) model, things are more complicated for complex actin networks, including because force generation [depend on filament orientation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27002174/).

We use simulations and elasticity theory to understand the force-velocity relationship in branched networks. Current results highlight that the growth speed of such networks depend on both filament stall force, and on the stress applied on the network, in a non-trivial manner. This project is spearheaded by [Magid Badaoui](https://www.ijm.fr/linstitut/annuaire/name/magid-badaoui/).

### Simulations of helical actin filaments
While actin filaments are often represented theoretically as semi-flexible filaments, they are actually helical filaments, that can be seen as helices of two protofilaments. This has important consequences, as the filament mechanical properties depend on their molecular architecture. Moreover, actin chirality can result in [chirality at the cell level](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30467170/).
 
We implemented in the software platform [cytosim](https://gitlab.com/f-nedelec/cytosim) a helical actin filament, that is compatible with the wide variety of the functionalities of the simulations. We thus can simulate chiral mesoscopic assemblies of actin filaments. This work is spearheaded by [Amir Khosravanizadeh](https://www.ijm.fr/linstitut/annuaire/name/amir-khosravanizadeh/).
